    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!--Hey thomas! -->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the "alt" attribute and the "title" attribute. </h4>
    <p>
      The alt code attribute creates alternative texts for an image creating a diffrent image if the original image cannot load. Or if older devices aren't able to access it. 
      The title attribute provides additional information or a tool that appears when a user hovers over the element. 
    </p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <p>This is an example of marking up a dictionary definition: <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;dd&gt;</code> tags:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Rover</dt>
      <dd>
        Refers to a person or a thing that rooms or travels around, or a type of robotic vehicle used for exploring remote or difficulte-to-reach areas, especially on the other planets.
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
